    "An emergency response organization or public utility company will, from time to time, have to deal with power outages on varying scales, and at those times may want to directly scan social media such as Twitter to see if people in a certain locality are posting about outages that need to be resolved. We have developed a proof of concept for this task, focused on the county level for the state of Washington: a model that can classify a tweet as outage-relevant or -irrelevant. A user could run this model on a live feed of tweets to determine which represent real power outages, then attend to those outages."
